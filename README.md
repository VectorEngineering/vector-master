# Vector Master Repository

Vector is a comprehensive financial services platform designed to empower small businesses with essential building blocks for growth and success. Our platform integrates three core pillars:

1. Financial Platform: Streamlined financial operations and accounting tools
2. Spend Management: Smart expense tracking and budget optimization
3. Lead Sourcing: Intelligent customer acquisition and business development tools

Our unified interface brings these essential business tools together, allowing small business owners to manage their operations efficiently without juggling multiple disconnected solutions.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're fixing a bug, improving the documentation, or adding a new feature, we appreciate your help in making PearAI better. There is a lot of context involved and we understand it can be overwhelming when first trying to join the project. Here is a quick summary of key information and how we currently work together:

- Pan and 
 conduct "Quests", which are 1-3 weeks sprints. We will pick out the current highest priority issues for these quests, ping everyone in our [Discord](<[url](https://discord.gg/7QMraJUsQt)>), and ask for applications to participate in them. The chosen people will help finish the tasks alongside us, participating in calls and working together. If help is needed, we may add more people to the quest. You can see the current open quests [here](https://github.com/orgs/trypear/projects?query=is%3Aopen).
- Outside of dedicated Quests, we also have a bunch of issues which are free to tackle (see the issues tab on individual repos). Make sure to leave a comment indicating you're working on it (check for existing comments also). You can raise a PR anytime and we usually review them pretty quickly.
- We have a lot on our plate so it's easy for us to miss something. The best way to get our attention is to ping us directly in our Discord server.

**Please review the `CONTRIBUTING.md`/`README.md` in the repositories you'd like to participate in.**
